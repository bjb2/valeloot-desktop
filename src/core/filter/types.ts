/**
 * The types `loot-dsl.ts` and `loot-filter.ts` borrow from their siblings, declared locally.
 *
 * VENDORED SHAPES, NOT THE ORIGINALS. In the project these two parser modules were written for they
 * import these from `inventory.ts`, `upgrades.ts` and `loot-actions.ts` — modules that carry a whole
 * inventory pipeline this repository has no use for. Every one of those imports is an `import type`,
 * erased before a single byte reaches the bundle, so dragging the modules in would add code that
 * cannot run and a dependency that cannot be justified.
 *
 * So they are re-declared here, deliberately as narrow as the two files' actual usage: `OwnedGear`
 * and `RollLine` list the fields the matcher READS and nothing else. TypeScript is structural, so a
 * caller holding a fuller item still satisfies these — the narrowing costs a caller nothing and
 * costs a reader of this repository three modules they would otherwise have to be handed.
 *
 * Every hand-written type is a place this can drift from the code it was copied from, which is the
 * argument for keeping the list short rather than the argument for copying more.
